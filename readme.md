This is where I throw in all my previous work.
It is for now (and maybe forever) work in progress.

THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS, NOT YET FIT FOR USE except by myself.

For the brave who want to explore what is there:
   attic - old stuff, do not look here
   book - nothing usefull here yet
   demo - demos of library features
   externals - external stuff used by godafoss, for now only my torsor
   library - here is the library itself
   tests - tests of library features
   work - for temporary stuff I am working on
