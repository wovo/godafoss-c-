This is where I throw in all my previous work.
It is for now (and maybe forever) work in progress.

THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS, NOT YET FIT FOR USE except by myself.

For the brave who want to explore what is here:
   attic - old stuff, do not look here
   book - nothing usefull here yet
   demo - demos of godafoss features
   documentation - I just started using tex for writing
   externals - external stuff used by godafoss, for now only my torsor
   library - here is the library itself
   tests - tests of the library
   work - for temporary stuff I am working in
