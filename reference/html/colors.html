<P>
The color abstract data types represent a color.
You wouldn't have guessed.
The main use of these types is to specify the color of a pixel on a display.
<P>
A color can be represented
in 1 bit (often black-or-white),
in 3 bits (one bit each for red, green and blue),
in one byte (3 bits each for red and green,
2 bits for blue because the eye is less sensitive to blue),
in 16 bits (5 bits each for red and blue, 6 bits for green
because the eye is most sensitive to green),
in 24 bits (one byte each for red, green and blue).
<P>
All color formats have the same interface.
The choice between the different color formats is dictated by the
balance between color resolution and memory size.
