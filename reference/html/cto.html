<P>
A cto is a Compile Time Object: it has the role of an object,
but it is 'created' at compile time.
It is implemented as a struct
that has only static functions and static attributes.
<P>
A cto always exists: it is just 'waiting' to be used.
The features of a cto that are not used will be elimiated by the linker,
Hence the mere presence of a cto in the source doen not increase
the size of the executable image.
<P>
A cto, being a type, is never instantiated.
Instead, each cto provides an init() function.
Before any of its functions or attributes are used at run-time,
a cto must be initialized by calling its init() function.
Failing to do so can cause unpredictable results.
<P>
As a cto has only static functions and attributes
it can be used directly, or the cto can be passed as
a template parameter.
<P>
For cto, and for each more specific cto, a concept exists
(with the name of the cto), and a root struct from which all
such cto's are derived (with _root appended to the name of the cto).
<P>
The concept checks both for a specific marker, which serves
no other purpose than to identify the specific cto, and for the
features that the cto is obliged to offer.
The concept is used to constrain templates that want to accept
only a cto that implements a specific set of features.
<P>
The root can be a plain struct, but it is often a template.
For more complex cto's the CRTP pattern is used so the root can
provide both base properties and enrichment based on the provided
implementation.

A cto has a static init() function that can be called without arguments.

<P>
The struct cto_root is the root type of all cto's:
all cto's inherit (in most cases indirectly) from this struct.
