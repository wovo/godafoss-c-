The reference documentation is generated by the make_reference.py script,
which must be run from this directory.
It generates the reference documentation in 3 formats:

   - [godafoss.rest](./godafoss.rest) (ReStructured Text format)
   - [godafoss.pdf](./godafoss.pdf) (A4 pdf generated from the rest file)
   - [html](./html/index.html) pages (in the html directory)
   - [markdown](./godafoss.md)

The documentation itself is embedded in the library files
in a propriatary format.
The examples directory contains runnable example code, of which
fragments are imported into the documentation examples.
The image directory contans the images used.

The reference documentation is provided under CC BY-ND license:
modifications are not allowed, but otherwise
you can use it any way you want (including commercial use).
