The reference documentation is generated by the make_reference.py script,
which must be run from this directory.
It generates the reference documentation in 3 formats:
   - godafoss.rest (ReStructured Text format)
   - godafoss.pdf (A4 pdf generated from the rest file)
   - html pages (in the html directory)

The documentation itself is embedded in the library files
in a propriatary format.
The examples directory contains runnable example code that is
imported as examples.
The image directory contans the images used.

The reference documentation is provided under CC-BY-SA license:
use it any way you want (including commerciakl use),
but any derivative work that you distribute must
attribute the author, and be
distributed under the same (CC-BY-SA) license.
