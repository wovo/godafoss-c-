<H2>background processing</H2>
from <A HREF="../../basics/gf-background.hpp">basics/gf-background.hpp</A><P>

<P>
<a name="background"></a>
<P>
The background class provides a hook for run-to-completion style
background processing.
<P>
<pre><code class="c++">struct background : public not_copyable {
   // This function will be called to do background work for its object.
   virtual void work() = 0;
};
</code></pre>
<P>
A class that needs background processing must inherit from background
and implement the work function. This work function will be called
when plain wait functions (the ones that allow background processing)
are called.
<P>
When an application contains background work,
all plain wait functions can take longer than the specified time,
up to the run time of the longest runtime of the work() functions.
<P>
No background work will be done from wait calls made while
a work() function is running.
<P>
For all background jobs: be careful to preserve the object,
or your servicing will end.
This is not UB: the background destructor
removes itself from the list of background jobs.
<P>
When the application would terminate (exit from its main()),
background::run() can be called instead, which will serve
the background processing (it will never return).
<P>
<pre><code class="c++">#include "godafoss.hpp"
namespace gf  = godafoss;

struct background_work: gf::background {

   auto last = gf::target::now_ms();

   void work() override(){
      now = gf::target::now_ms();
      if( now > last + 1'000 ){
         gf::cout << "Another second has passed\n";
      }
   }

};

int main(){

   {
      background_work annnoying;
      for( int i = 0; i < 10; ++i ){
         gf::wait_ms( 2'800 );
         gf::cout << "[" << i << "] 2.8 seconds passed\n"
      }
      // annnoying is destructed here, so it will finally shut up
   }

   for( int i = 0; i < 10; ++i ){
      gf::wait_ms( 2'100 );
      gf::cout << "[" << i << "] 2.1 seconds passed\n"
